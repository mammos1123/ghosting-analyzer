# 👻 Ghosting Analyzer

**Ghosting Analyzer** is an application that helps job seekers understand
possible reasons behind job application rejections by analyzing CVs against
job descriptions using AI-based and rule-based approaches.

The project is designed not only as a functional product but also as a
**production-oriented backend system** with a strong focus on reliability
and supportability.

## 🚀 Core Functionality
- CV and job description analysis
- Match score and ATS readability evaluation
- Probable rejection / ghosting reasons
- Actionable CV improvement suggestions
- Analysis history per user

## 🧠 Production & Support Perspective

This project is built with real-world **application support and production
operations** in mind:

- External dependency handling (AI provider availability)
- Automatic fallback to a rule-based engine when AI services fail
- Structured logging for incident investigation
- Secure authentication and protected endpoints
- Containerized deployment using Docker
- Configuration management via environment variables

The system is designed to remain operational and debuggable even under
partial failures, simulating realistic production scenarios.
