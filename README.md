# 👻 Ghosting Analyzer

**Ghosting Analyzer** is an AI-powered application that helps job seekers understand  
*why they didn’t get a response* after applying for a job.

Upload your CV, paste a job description, analyze — and clearly see  
**why you were likely rejected or ghosted**.

## 🧠 AI & Analysis Logic

- Uses **Hugging Face Inference API** with LLM-based reasoning
- If AI is unavailable, automatically falls back to a **rule-based analysis engine**
- Each analysis is generated **specifically for the given CV and job posting**
- Results are probabilistic, not absolute (real-world hiring logic)
